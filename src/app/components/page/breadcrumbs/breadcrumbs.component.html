    <p>Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation element that allow users to quickly understand their current location within
        a website or application, and easily navigate back to previous pages. Here are some guidelines for designing
        breadcrumbs in a design system:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use clear, descriptive labels:</strong> The labels in a breadcrumb trail should accurately reflect
            the content and structure of the site. Use clear, concise language that accurately describes the content of
            each page.</li>

        <li><strong>Provide clear visual hierarchy:</strong> Make it easy for users to identify the current page and the
            available options for navigating to other pages. This can be achieved through the use of visual hierarchy,
            such as using larger or bolder text for the current page and smaller, lighter text for other pages.</li>

        <li><strong>Offer a range of navigation options:</strong> In addition to previous and next buttons, consider
            including options for jumping to the first or last page, as well as options for skipping ahead or back by a
            certain number of pages.</li>

        <li><strong>Consider mobile-friendliness:</strong> When designing for small screens, consider how the breadcrumb
            elements will be displayed. It may be necessary to hide some navigation options or use a different layout to
            ensure that the breadcrumb is easy to use on a smaller screen.</li>

        <li><strong>Use appropriate spacing and alignment:</strong> Proper spacing and alignment can help to make the
            breadcrumb elements more legible and easier to use. Use consistent spacing between elements and align
            elements according to the overall layout of the page.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By following these guidelines, you can help to create a breadcrumb experience that is clear, intuitive, and easy
        to use for your users.</p>
