  <p>Modals are a common design pattern used to display important or critical information in a prominent way. Here are some guidelines for designing modal elements within a design system:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use clear, concise language:</strong> Modals should convey brief information in a clear, concise manner. Avoid using jargon or technical language, and keep the message brief and to the point.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Use appropriate visual hierarchy:</strong> Use visual hierarchy to draw attention to the most important information in the modal and convey the level of importance. For example, you might use a larger or bolder font size for the most important information, and a smaller or lighter font size for less important information.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Consider mobile-friendliness:</strong> When designing for small screens, consider how the modal will be displayed. It may be necessary to use a different layout or truncate the message to ensure that the modal is easy to read and understand on a smaller screen.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Use appropriate spacing and alignment:</strong> Proper spacing and alignment can help to make the modal more legible and easier to read. Use consistent spacing between elements and align elements according to the overall layout of the page.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Provide clear actions or next steps:</strong> If applicable, the modal should clearly communicate any necessary actions or next steps for the user. Make it easy for users to understand what they need to do and how to do it.</li>
    
  </ul>
    
    <p>By following these guidelines, you can help to create a modal experience that is clear, concise, and easy to understand for your users.</p>
