<p>Buttons are an important element in user interfaces, as they allow users to take action and interact with the interface. When designing buttons for a design system, it's important to consider the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use clear and descriptive labels:</strong> The text on a button should clearly and accurately describe the action that will be taken when the button is clicked. Avoid using ambiguous or vague labels.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Use a consistent button style:</strong> The style of the buttons should be consistent throughout the design system. This includes the font, color, size, and overall layout of the buttons.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Use appropriate button sizes:</strong> Button sizes should be appropriate for the context in which they are used. Large buttons may be more suitable for primary actions, while smaller buttons may be more suitable for secondary actions.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Use appropriate button colors:</strong> Button colors should be used to communicate the importance or context of the action being taken. For example, a red button may be used to indicate a destructive action, while a green button may be used to indicate a positive action.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Use hover and active states:</strong> It should be clear to users which button is currently being hovered over or clicked on. This can be achieved through the use of visual indicators such as changes in color or size.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Consider the use of icon buttons:</strong> Icon buttons can be used in addition to or in place of text labels to provide a more visually appealing and concise design. However, it's important to ensure that the meaning of the button is still clear to users.</li>
</ul>
  
  <p>By following these guidelines, you can create a clear and intuitive button interface that helps users easily take action and interact with the interface.</p>
